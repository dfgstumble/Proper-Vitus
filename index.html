            File Infector: This type of virus add virus code to the regular programming code. So when this file is run, this infects other files
            <BR>
            Boot Sector Virus: This type of virus infects the boot sector of the disk, which is read every time the computer is started up. This contains the file-allocation tables and start-up instructions. This virus is also dangerous
            <BR>
            Executable Virus: This virus infects executable files (files ending with .exe)
            <BR>
            Macro Virus: This type of virus infects programmes made by applications which use macros. These macros help in automating the operations, so the user doesn't have to do the operations one by one
